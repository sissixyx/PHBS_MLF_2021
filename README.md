# Project Introduction
Reinforcing bar, or rebar, is a common steel bar that is hot rolled and is used widely in the construction industry, especially for concrete reinforcement. Steel rebar is most used as a tensioning device to reinforce concrete and other masonry structures to help hold the concrete in a compressed state. Since it is widely used in the construction, the price of the rebar is an important indicator of the economy health, and it is also commonly traded in the commodity market. The purpose of the project is to estimate the price trend of the rebar futures based on some fundamental data so that we can make the trading strategies accordingly in a low-mid frequency.
